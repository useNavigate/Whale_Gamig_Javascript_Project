## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
> -  `mmobomb-api` (https://www.mmobomb.com/api)
> - `d3.js` (https://d3js.org/)



## Implementation Timeline
> ### Friday
> - fetch all the API data
> - render basic html
>   - navbar / main page

> ### Saturday
> - Data construction
> - Learn about d3 line graph 
> - Parse data to csv

> ### Sunday
> - Render basic d3 line graph

> ### Monday
> - DOM
>   - Added featured functionality eventlistners for 
>      - Click ( navbar / main page / filter)
>   - Input (search)
>      - To enhance the user experience, we improved the search functionality by implementing a delay in fetching results. This means that the API won't be called immediately when the user types in the search bar, but rather after a brief pause in typing. This approach helps to reduce unnecessary API calls and provides a more seamless search experience.
